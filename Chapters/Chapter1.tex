\section{What I did during the Internship period}

\subsection{Studied the Software's(nukeboard.co) codebase}

Before coding on the software, I had to learn the coding style of the application, understand the work flow of the software in order to know what nukeboard.co actually does. This took me 2 days since the software was not very complex and I had all the skills necessary to start working on the platform. After these 2 days of extreme study, I immediately started writing codes for the software.

\subsection{Work I did on Nukeboard during internship}

During a period of 5 months internship at Njorku Ltd Buea, I was assigned the following task to work on which i did successfully and was evaluated on. The tasks are listed as follows:

- Developed Features(Modules) on Nukeboard.

- Did Quality Assurance(QA) on the software.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Why did I do the following task mentioned above?}

\subsection{Why Feature Development?}

I developed modules for nukeboard because the software was targetting users who are not very experienced with Computing and we had to build modules for the software to make the work or tasks very easy for the users to accomplish and also to make usability of the software easy to the end users. Modules were also build to make sure that more features where added to the software based on the users demands from the market.

\subsection{Why Quality Assurance(QA)?}

Quality Assurance was done to ensure that the software is properly build and we meet the purpose of the software. I carried out the task so that the team of programmers working on the software can know which part of the software needs improvement and changes. After this task was complete, I had done 53 test cases and details about this will be available below.

As mentioned above, I shall explain in detail all what I carried during my intership period and research done, other activities out of internship site and other projects done which where in one way or the other related to the internship. All these shall be explain in the body of this internship report.
