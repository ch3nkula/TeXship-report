\begin{abstract}

	Faculty of Engineering and Technology places level 500 students on internship for a period of 6 months, in which I was included and did my internship at Njorku Cameroon Ltd. This company offers internship to engineering interns to work on real live project(which some are highly the business of the company) and follows an incremental engineering problem solving approach. During my 5 months of internship in the company, We worked on implementing modules for one the company's project called "nukeboard.co" in which we used to offer services to the clients and the market. The projects design and most of the engineering phase where already done so we where just there to implement. Nukeboard.co is an internet recruitement based solution which enables recruiters to easily post jobs, share job offers on social media, track and manage applications(job applications) across multiple devices while maintaining and growing a CV bank. Developing modules to this software was one of the key feature to the success of this application since it brought about ease in the manageability of activities to the end users. Various modules developed are; Employer Module, Job Seeker Module, Training Module, Sponsored Jobs Module and Blog module making a total of 5 modules(as at now). These modules where developed in a very modular approach in such a way that if one doesn't need a particular module which has to be removed entirely from the whole software, it will be a very easy process and this won't break other existing modules already available in the application. So this means it will be like singly removing a module and not touching the exising modules, making it easy for integration of other modules in future and making development to the software easy to understand. The above mentioned modules will be explained in detail in the body of this report.

Furthermore I would also like to acknowledge with much appreciation the crucial role of the staff of {\facname}, who gave the permission to use all required equipment and the necessary materials to complete the  task \enquote{\ttitle}. A special thanks goes to my team mate, Fonji Fonkeng Rocard, with whom i worked in collaboration with on the project “Nukeboard”. To continue, special thanks to all my friends and mostly my mentor from childhood Mr. Nkwa Walters Chuo who really helped me into the amazing world of IT. Last but not least, many thanks go to the head of the project, Mr. Churchill Mambe Nanje, who has invested his full effort in guiding the team in achieving the goal for this project. I have to appreciate the guidance given by other supervisor as well as the panels especially in our project presentation that has improved our presentation skills thanks to their comment and advices.\ldots
